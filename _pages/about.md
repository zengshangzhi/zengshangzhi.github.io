I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.uvic.ca/science/math-statistics/index.php) at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca), working under the supervision of [Professor Jane Juanjuan Ye](https://www.math.uvic.ca/faculty/janeye/). I received my Bachelor degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn) in 2015. Subsequently, I obtained my MPhil degree from [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk) in 2017 and completed my PhD at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk) in 2021, under the supervision of [Professor Xiaoming Yuan](https://hkumath.hku.hk/~xmyuan/). During my postdoctoral from 2021 to 2023, I was supported by the PIMS (Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences) Post-doctoral Fellowship.
